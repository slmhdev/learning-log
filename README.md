# learning-log
Documenting my progress through programming, computer science, and blockchain fundamentals.

## About Repo
- To document what I’m learning
- Outlining my mistakes, fixes, and concepts that "clicked"
- Weekly and monthly reflections to track progress over time

This is not a portfolio or a collection of finished projects (yet).

---

## Current Focus
- Python fundamentals
- CS fundamentals
- Learning how to study, debug, and think clearly while coding

As my progress continues, this log will expand into JavaScript, Solidity, and Rust.
